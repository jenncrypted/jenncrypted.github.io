                    Hi, my name is Jennifer Paz. With a background in International Relations, I've developed strong communication, analytical, and problem solving skills, all of which have proven invaluable as I transition into the world of web development.
                    Currently, Iâ€™m focused on growing as a frontend developer, specializing in building responsive, user-focused interfaces using JavaScript and React.
                    I'm passionate about continuous learning and excited to apply both my academic and technical strengths to meaningful projects.
                </p>
            </motion.div>
        </motion.section>
    );
};
